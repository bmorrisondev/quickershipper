# QuickerShipper
A parcel shipping web app built with Vue &amp; Node, hosted on AWS

# Detail
This is technically the third version of the app. The first was built using C# & WPF only. The second was an attempt with Angular. I built the app to help my wife automate the shipping process of her business.

It is currently hosted in AWS using Lambda & API Gateway. This project is deprecated in favor of Enviari, a closed source version which I plan to launch in Q3 2019. No further development will take place. It is here for referrence only.
